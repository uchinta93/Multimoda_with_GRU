Google Drive Integration: The script starts by mounting Google Drive to access stored datasets, a common practice when working with Google Colab.
Import Statements: Various libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, keras, and matplotlib are imported, indicating the script's reliance on data manipulation, machine learning models, and plotting functionalities.
Data Preprocessing: The script includes steps for loading, normalizing, and scaling the data. This is crucial for preparing the dataset for model training.
Model Creation and Training:
A complex model involving Convolutional and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layers is created, hinting at a deep learning approach suitable for both time-series (EEG data) and image data (facial data).
Custom functions and loss are defined for model optimization.
The model is compiled and trained on the preprocessed data.
Data Resampling: Techniques like SMOTE and Random Under/Oversampling are used, suggesting that the dataset might be imbalanced, and these methods are employed to address this.
Feature Extraction and Ensemble Methods:
The script extracts features from the trained model and applies different resampling methods to prepare the dataset for further analysis.
Various classifiers such as XGBClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, and SVC (Support Vector Classifier) are trained.
A voting classifier, combining different models, is used for making the final predictions.
Model Evaluation:
The script includes extensive model evaluation, utilizing confusion matrices, ROC curves, precision-recall curves, and classification reports.
The models' performances are measured in terms of accuracy, AUC scores, precision, recall, and F1-scores.
Parameter Tuning and Cross-Validation: Grid search and cross-validation are employed to fine-tune model parameters and validate their performances.
Final Predictions and Evaluation: The voting classifier is used for the final predictions on the test set, followed by evaluation using various metrics.
